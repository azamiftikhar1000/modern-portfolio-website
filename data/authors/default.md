I am a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer with 7+ years of experience in Machine Learning and Software Development. My focus is on helping startups and enterprises leverage AI to boost their revenue and gain a competitive edge.

With my passion for technology and innovation, I have successfully generated over \$10M in revenue through AI solutions for a mid-scale startup. Moreover, I have led a [project](https://currentph.com/2021/06/30/covid-19-detection-and-protection-fastest-through-idetect-via-a1-intelligence/) that used Computer Vision to detect Covid from eye images. The project received \$12.6M funding and was later acquired by a S&P 500 company.

As a "Top Rated Plus" freelancer on Upwork, I am proud to be part of the top 1% of talent on the platform. I hold a Masters in Information Technology and a certified expert by Stanford, AWS, and Microsoft Azure.

My ultimate mission is to help businesses overcome their competition and use AI to achieve revenue growth. Together, we can make this happen!

Let's work together and take your business to the next level.
