In this article we'll be setting up AWS CLI and credentials which is useful when we want to interact with our aws services or resources programmatically.

## Setting up AWS Credentials

Before we can install and setup our AWS CLI we will require `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
So, let's look at how we can get those from the aws console

_Note: we will be creating a new IAM user rather than creating access keys on the root aws account which is generally a good practice_

**Add a new user**

Let's start by going over to IAM dashboard and add a new user

Give a user name and allow programmatic access

**Attach policies**

This is the most important part. Here, we will attach policies that will give the user appropriate access to the AWS services.

_For demonstration purposes I've attached a AWS managed policy `AmazonS3FullAccess`_

**Tags (optional)**

It's always good to tag our resources but this is optional.

**Review**

Let's give it a final review and then click `Create user`

**Secrets**

The user has been created and now we will be able to get our secrets

_Note: This is the only time you'll be able to view the Secret Access Key ID so be sure to write it down or download the CSV._

Our new user was created!

## Install AWS CLI

We can install AWS CLI from docs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

## Configure AWS CLI

Let's configure the CLI for single user

**Single user**

```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <Your Access Key ID>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <Your Secret Access Key ID>
Default region name [None]: <Your preferred AWS region>
Default output format [None]: json
```

After the configuration the credentials will be stored at `~/.aws/credentials`

_Here's a list of all the [aws regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Regions)_

**Multiple profiles (optional)**

Profiles are really helpful if you're working with multiple users/accounts.

```
$ aws configure --profile xyz
```

We can switch between profiles using `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.
For example: `export AWS_PROFILE=xyz`

_Note: it is recommended to create a new IAM user with limited permissions and generating access keys for that user instead [read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html)_

```
$ aws configure list

Name                    Value               Type      Location
----                    -----               ----      --------
profile                 ********           manual    --profile
access_key            *********ABCD   shared-credentials-file
secret_key            *********ABCD   shared-credentials-file
region                  <not set>             None      None
```

Finally, Let's see if it works!

```
$ aws s3 ls
```

If everything is setup correctly, we should see an output.

### Next steps

Now that we've created our aws credentials securely, we can can now use them with AWS CLI or SDK and even terraform!
