Go is quickly becoming one of my favorite languages to work with. So, today we'll dockerize our Go app by taking advantage of builder pattern and multistage builds to reduce our docker image from `850mb` to just `15mb`!

_This article is part of the Dockerize series, make sure to checkout the [Introduction](https://azamiftikhar.dev/blog/introduction-dockerize-series) where I go over some concepts which we are going to use. Code from this article is available [here](https://github.com/azamiftikhar1000/tutorials/tree/master/go)_

### Project setup

I've initialized a simple api using [Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)

```
├── main.go
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

Here's our `main.go`

```js
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func main() {
	router := mux.NewRouter()
	router.HandleFunc("/", func(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		response := map[string]string{
			"message": "Hello Docker!",
		}
		json.NewEncoder(rw).Encode(response)
	})

	log.Println("Server is running!")
	http.ListenAndServe(":4000", router)
}
```

### For development

We'll be using [Reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex) as part of our development workflow. If you're not familiar, Refelx provides live reload when developing.

Let's continue our docker setup by adding a `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.16.5 as development
# Add a work directory
WORKDIR /app
# Cache and install dependencies
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
# Copy app files
COPY . .
# Install Reflex for development
RUN go install github.com/cespare/reflex@latest
# Expose port
EXPOSE 4000
# Start app
CMD reflex -g '*.go' go run api.go --start-service
```

Let's create a `docker-compose.yml`. Here we'll also mount our code in a [volume](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/7500/what-are-docker-volumes-and-how-do-you-use-them/) so that we can sync our changes with the container while developing.

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    container_name: app-dev
    image: app-dev
    build:
      context: .
      target: development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
```

Start! Start! Start!

```
docker-compose up
```

_we can also use the `-d` flag to run in daemon mode_

Great, our dev server is up!

```
app-dev  | Starting service...
app-dev  | 2021/07/04 12:50:06 Server is running!
```

Let's checkout our image using `docker images` command

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                   IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
app-dev             latest                3063740d56d8   7 minutes ago   872MB
```

Over `850mb` for a hello world! While this might be okay for development, but for production let's see how we can reduce our image size

### For production

Let's update our `Dockerfile` by adding a `builder` and `production` stage

_Update: Notice how we define `CGO_ENABLED 0` with `ENV` in `Dockerfile` rather than doing directly before `go build` command. Also, we will be using `alpine` instead of `scratch` as it's really hard to debug containers in production with `scratch`_

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.16.5 as builder
# Define build env
ENV GOOS linux
ENV CGO_ENABLED 0
# Add a work directory
WORKDIR /app
# Cache and install dependencies
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
# Copy app files
COPY . .
# Build app
RUN go build -o app

FROM alpine:3.14 as production
# Add certificates
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
# Copy built binary from builder
COPY --from=builder app .
# Expose port
EXPOSE 4000
# Exec built binary
CMD ./app
```

Let's add a build our production image

```
docker build -t app-prod . --target production
```

Let's check out our built production image

```
docker images
```

Using builder pattern we reduced out image size to just `~15mb`!!

```
REPOSITORY                    TAG                   IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
app-prod                      latest                ed84a3896251   50 seconds ago   14.7MB
```

let's start our production container on port `80`

```
docker run -p 80:4000 --name app-prod app-prod
```

We can also add a [`Makefile`](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) to make our workflow easier

```make
dev:
  docker-compose up

build:
  docker build -t app-prod . --target production

start:
  docker run -p 80:4000 --name app-prod app-prod
```

## Next steps

With that, we should be able to take advantage of docker in our workflow and deploy our production images faster to any platform of our choice.
