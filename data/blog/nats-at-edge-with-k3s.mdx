In this article, we will setup NATS with K3s which is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution by [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/)

### What is NATS?

![https://nats.io/img/logos/nats-horizontal-color.png](https://nats.io/img/logos/nats-horizontal-color.png)

NATS is a cloud native [open-source](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server) messaging system. It provides a simple, secure, and performant communications system for digital systems, services, and devices. The core design principles of NATS are performance, scalability, and ease of use. Written in Go and distributed as a 15MB binary with no 3rd party dependencies it can run on-premise, in the cloud, at the edge, and even on a Raspberry Pi.

NATS can secure and simplify the design and operation of modern distributed systems. It is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project that is used by [thousands of companies](https://nats.io) globally.

### What is K3s?

![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29705703/157869118-990a95a9-10cb-4dac-a046-af4916da3729.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29705703/157869118-990a95a9-10cb-4dac-a046-af4916da3729.png)

K3s is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.

K3s is packaged as a single `<50MB` binary that reduces the dependencies and steps needed to install, run and auto-update a production Kubernetes cluster.

Both ARM64 and ARMv7 are supported with binaries and multi-arch images available for both. K3s works great from something as small as a Raspberry Pi to large-scale production servers.

### K3s Installation

Let's start by installing K3s on ubuntu.

_Note: If you're using MacOS or Windows, checkout [K3d](https://k3d.io/) which is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Lab's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in Docker_

```
$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
[INFO]  Finding release for channel stable

Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/k3s.service → /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.
[INFO]  systemd: Starting k3s
```

Now after a few seconds, our node should be ready.

```
$ k3s kubectl get node
NAME     STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
ubuntu   Ready    control-plane,master   37s   v1.22.7+k3s1
```

Next, we need to export our `KUBECONFIG`

```
$ export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

All done, Now we have K3s up and running!

### Basic Setup

Let's start by first deploying a basic NATS server on our K3s Kubernetes cluster.

**Deployment**

Let's declare our deployment in deployment.yml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nats
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy: {}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nats
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nats
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nats
          image: nats:2.7.3-alpine
          ports:
            - containerPort: 4222
```

**Service**

Let's declare a service in a service.yml file and expose our deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nats
spec:
  selector:
    app: nats
  ports:
    - port: 4222
```

**Apply**

Time to create our resources

```
$ k3s kubectl apply -f nats.yaml
deployment.apps/nats created
service/nats created
```

```
$ k3s kubectl get all
NAME                        READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE

```

```

```

### Helm

In this section, let's see how we can use helm to deploy a NATS server with high availability. Helm is the preferred way of setting up NATS for your production workloads.

_Learn more about the NATS Helm chart [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/nats/nats)_

**Install**

We will start by installing helm and adding `nats` helm chart.

```
$ sudo snap install helm --classic
```

```
$ helm repo add nats https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts/
"nats" has been added to your repositories
```

```
$ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "nats" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
```

```
$ helm repo list
NAME	URL
nats	<https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts/>
```

**Deploy**
Now, let's install the `nats/nats` helm chart.

```
$ helm install nats-k3s nats/nats
NAME: nats-k3s
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Mar 11 03:47:58 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
You can find more information about running NATS on Kubernetes
in the NATS documentation website:

  https://docs.nats.io/nats-on-kubernetes/nats-kubernetes

NATS Box has been deployed into your cluster, you can
now use the NATS tools within the container as follows:

  kubectl exec -n default -it deployment/nats-k3s-box -- /bin/sh -l

  nats-box:~# nats-sub test &
  nats-box:~# nats-pub test hi
  nats-box:~# nc nats-k3s 4222

Thanks for using NATS!
```

Let's check the resources that got created. As we can see, we have helm automatically created statefulsets, services, pods, etc that will help us to run our NATS cluster effortlessly.

```
$ kubectl get all
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/nats-k3s-box-76f896544-xs6nr   1/1     Running   0          59s
pod/nats-k3s-0                     3/3     Running   0          59s

service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.43.0.1    <none>        443/TCP                                                 110m

NAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/nats-k3s-box-76f896544   1         1         1       59s

NAME                        READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/nats-k3s   1/1     59s
```

Finally, Let's check the logs to verify that it's up and running

```
$ k3s kubectl logs service/nats-k3s -c nats
[8] 2022/03/11 11:48:17.227997 [INF] Starting nats-server

[8] 2022/03/11 11:48:17.229761 [INF] Server is ready
```

**Interacting with NATS**

If we look closely, we also have `nats-k3s-box`, which will help us interact with NATS. So, let's ssh into the deployment.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it deployment/nats-k3s-box -- sh
~ #
```

Let's run a simple benchmark

```bash
$ nats bench test --msgs=10000000 --pub 5 --sub 2
07:44:03 Starting pub/sub benchmark [msgs=10,000,000, msgsize=128 B, pubs=5, subs=2, js=false]

  min 1,134,570 | avg 1,138,115 | max 1,141,660 | stddev 3,545 msgs
```

This is absolutely amazing performance by K3s and NATS. For context, this is running on a [SUSE Linux](https://www.suse.com/en-en/products/micro/) Enterprise Micro VM with 2GB memory!

**Uninstall**

As always, let's cleanup our resources.

```
$ helm uninstall nats-k3s
release "nats-k3s" uninstalled
```

### Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to setup NATS with K3s which is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution by [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/).
