Recently, I was building an application where I wanted to take event-driven approach for async communication between the microservices. Usually, I would use [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-go.html), [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro) or a managed solution like [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) but this time I wanted to keep my implementation easy and cost minimal yet not affect my scalability or increase technical debt for the future. After a few hops on [StackShare](stackshare.io), I found [NATS](https://nats.io) as a popular alternative and after trying it out, I really liked it. That evening I migrated everything from Apache Kafka to NATS. So, in this article, we'll learn what NATS is and how to get started with it.

### What is NATS?

![nats](https://nats.io/img/logos/nats-horizontal-color.png)

NATS is an [open-source](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server) messaging system. It provides a simple, secure, and performant communications system for digital systems, services, and devices. The core design principles of NATS are performance, scalability, and ease of use. Its server can run on-premise, in the cloud, at the edge, and even on a Raspberry Pi. NATS can secure and simplify the design and operation of modern distributed systems. It is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and used by companies like Tesla, Paypal, Walmart, and many others. NATS is also part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/)).

### Features

Here are some of the features that I found interesting for my use case:

- Ease of use
- Highly performant
- Zero downtime scaling
- Self healing and resilient
- Isolated and secure by default
- Supports edge, cloud or hybrid deployments.

### Getting started

Before we start with any code, let's see what we will implement. We will try to make a simple pub/sub example like shown in the diagram below, and we will use different languages and pretend they are different services.

#### Setup NATS server

Before anything, we'll need to set up a NATS server. We can do it multiple ways as shown below. Personally, I like to use docker but feel free to set it up however you want. We can also use `demo.nats.io` which is a demo server provider by NATS authors (please don't use it for production!).

**Docker**

Here's our `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nats:
    container_name: nats
    image: nats:2.7.0-alpine
    ports:
      - 4222:4222
```

```
$ docker compose up
```

Or we can simply use `docker run` as well.

```
$ docker run -p 4222:4222 nats:2.7.0-alpine
```

**Locally**

As I'm using macOS, I installed it with [`brew`](https://brew.sh/).

```
$ brew install nats-server
$ nats-server
```

_Note: Checkout [official docs](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation) for more installation options._

**Output**

```

#### Client

Now that our NATS server is running, we'll be using [Go](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go) and [Node.js](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.js) clients to connect to it for a simple demonstration. Not familiar with Go or Node? Don't worry NATS has clients available in [over 40 languages](https://nats.io/download)!

First, let's init our Go module.

```
$ go mod init example
$ go get github.com/nats-io/nats.go/@latest
$ touch main.go
```

Our Go code will act as the subscriber.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
)

var subject = "my_subject"

func main() {
	wait := make(chan bool)

	nc, err := nats.Connect(nats.DefaultURL)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}

	nc.Subscribe(subject, func(m *nats.Msg) {
		fmt.Printf("Received: %s\n", string(m.Data))
		nc.Publish(m.Reply, []byte("Hello"))
	})

	fmt.Println("Subscribed to", subject)

	<-wait
}
```

Now, let's init our Node project.

```
$ npm init -y
$ npm install nats
$ touch index.js
```

Here is our JavaScript code that will act as the publisher.

```js
const { connect, StringCodec } = require('nats');

const subject = 'my_subject';
const servers = 'localhost:4222';

async function demo() {
  const codec = StringCodec();
  const nc = await connect({ servers });

  nc.publish(subject, codec.encode('Hello there!'));

  console.log('Sent...');

  await nc.drain();
}

demo();
```

We will subscribe to the `my_subject` subject by running our Go code first.

```
$ go run main.go
Subscribed to my_subject
```

Now, We will run our JavaScript code, which publishes `Hello there!` message on `my_subject` subject.

```
$ node index.js
Sent...
```

And there it is! We can see the message being received by our subscriber. NATS makes this so simple, yet so powerful!

```
Subscribed to my_subject
Received: Hello there!
```

### Conclusion

We haven't even scratched the surface in this article, NATS also has a built-in distributed persistence system called [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) which takes it to a whole another level!

Lastly, I think NATS is a fantastic technology, it scales well from a hobby project to production ready distributed applications. And best of all it's quite easy to get started. I hope this article was helpful in getting you interested!
