Hey, welcome back. This article is part of the Dockerize series, make sure to checkout the [Introduction](https://azamiftikhar.dev/blog/introduction-dockerize-series) where I go over some concepts we are going to use.

Today we'll dockerize our React application by taking advantage of builder pattern with multi stage builds for optimization!

### Project setup

I've initialized a pretty standard react project using the default [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) template.

All the code from this article will be available in [this repo](https://github.com/azamiftikhar1000/tutorials)

```
├── node_modules
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── robots.txt
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── logo.svg
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

### For development

Let's start by adding a `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine AS development
ENV NODE_ENV development
# Add a work directory
WORKDIR /app
# Cache and Install dependencies
COPY package.json .
COPY yarn.lock .
RUN yarn install
# Copy app files
COPY . .
# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000
# Start the app
CMD [ "yarn", "start" ]
```

Add a `.dockerignore`, this will help us ignore `node_modules`, `.env` etc

```
**/node_modules
**/npm-debug.log
build
```

Let's create a `docker-compose.dev.yml`. Here we'll also mount our code in a [volume](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/7500/what-are-docker-volumes-and-how-do-you-use-them/) so that we can sync our changes with the container while developing.

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    container_name: app-dev
    image: app-dev
    build:
      context: .
      target: development
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

Let's start our react app for development!

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

We can also add it to our `package.json`

```json
"dev": "docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up"
```

_we can use the `-d` flag to run in daemon mode_

Let's check our container!

```
docker ps
```

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                   IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
app-dev            latest                5064f3e40c97   About a minute ago    436MB
```

Over `400mb`!! Don't worry, this is just for development. We'll optimize our production build with builder pattern!

### For production

We'll use [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) to serve our static assets and will help resolve routes when we're using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) or any kind of routing.

_Note: Personally, I do not recommend using static server packages like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) in production, nginx gives us much more performance and control_

Let's create a `nginx.conf`

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;

  location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html/;
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
}
```

Let's update our `Dockerfile` for `production`

```dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine AS builder
ENV NODE_ENV production
# Add a work directory
WORKDIR /app
# Cache and Install dependencies
COPY package.json .
COPY yarn.lock .
RUN yarn install --production
# Copy app files
COPY . .
# Build the app
RUN yarn build

# Bundle static assets with nginx
FROM nginx:1.21.0-alpine as production
ENV NODE_ENV production
# Copy built assets from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
# Add your nginx.conf
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
# Expose port
EXPOSE 80
# Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Let's add a `docker-compose.prod.yml` file

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    container_name: app-prod
    image: app-prod
    build:
      context: .
      target: production
```

Build production image

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
```

Let's check out our built production image

```
docker images
```

Using builder pattern we reduced out image size to just `~23mb`!!

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                   IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
app-prod           latest                c5db8d308bb9   About a minute ago   23.1MB
```

let's start our production container on port `80` with the name `react-app`

```
docker run -p 80:80 --name react-app app-prod
```

## Optimizing static assets (Bonus)

You can also add the following inside the `location` block to introduce caching for our static assets and javascript bundle.

You can refer this [guide](https://gist.github.com/philipstanislaus/654adafad91efb6de230845b5bdeae61) to dive deep into optimizing

```nginx
# Cache static assets
location ~* \.(?:jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|svg)$ {
  expires 7d;
  add_header Cache-Control "public";
}

# Cache css and js bundle
location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {
  add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, public, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate";
}
```

## Next steps

With that, we should be able to take advantage of docker in our workflow and deploy our production images faster to any platform of our choice.
