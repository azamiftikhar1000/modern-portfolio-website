Few weeks ago I was playing around with [Wolt](https://wolt.com/en) iOS app, I was really impressed by how the app handled image load and placeholders. After looking around I finally found [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh)

## Why would I need it?

Blurhash can help with transforming boring image placeholders into something more.

## Using with TypeScript and React

#### Install

```bash
yarn add blurhash
```

#### Encode an image

```ts
import { encode } from 'blurhash';

const loadImage = async (src: string): Promise<HTMLImageElement> =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.onload = () => resolve(img);
    img.onerror = (...args) => reject(args);
    img.src = src;
  });

const getImageData = (image: HTMLImageElement): ImageData => {
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  canvas.width = image.width;
  canvas.height = image.height;
  const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
  context.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
  return context.getImageData(0, 0, image.width, image.height);
};

const encodeImage = async (url: string) => {
  const image: HTMLImageElement = await loadImage(url);
  const imageData: ImageData = getImageData(image);
  return encode(imageData.data, imageData.width, imageData.height, 4, 4);
};
```

#### Store blurhash alongside your images

When storing images to S3 bucket, I usually run encode function on the image from S3 and store it alongside the image url in the database so that it's easier.

Personally I store image in it's own object representation as follows:

```json
...
"image": {
  "url": "https://project-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/...",
  "blurhash": "LKO2?U%2Tw=w]~RBVZRi};RPxuwH"
}
...
```

#### Using with React

After storing the hash on the server, it's quite easier to use it with React without any manual decoding with [react-blurhash](https://github.com/woltapp/react-blurhash).

```jsx
import { BlurhashCanvas } from 'react-blurhash';

<Blurhash
  hash='<image_hash>'
  width={400}
  height={300}
  resolutionX={32}
  resolutionY={32}
/>;
```

<i>
  Note: you can also decode the hash manually, checkout [blurhash
  docs](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash) for more details
</i>

## Experiment online!

There's an online generator available if would like to try it out yourself.
