Seeding postgres container during local development can be bit cumbersome, at least during the initial setup. Usually, we connect to the container and execute the seed script.

But now, let's see how we can automate that by using `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, which runs all the `*.sh` or `*.sql` scripts on initialization.

**Setup**

Let's assume we have this folder structure:

```
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
└── scripts
    └── db
        ├── dump.sql
        └── init.sh
```

Here, `dump.sql` can be sql script that we want to seed the db with

```sql
-- CreateTable
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "email" TEXT NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

-- Seed
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES ('userid', 'Gopher', 'hello@gopher.com');
```

In the `init.sh`, we will just execute our `*.sql` script.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB -a -f /app/scripts/db/dump.sql
```

In the `Dockerfile`, we will copy our `init.sh` to `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory.

```dockerfile
FROM postgres:12 as db
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./scripts/db/init.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
COPY ./scripts/db/dump.sql ./scripts/db/dump.sql
```

We will define our `docker-compose.yml` like below:

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  db:
    image: db
    container_name: db
    build:
      context: .
      target: db
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=database
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```

Let's start our containers!

```
$ docker compose up
```
