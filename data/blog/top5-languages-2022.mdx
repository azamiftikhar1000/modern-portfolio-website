In this article, we'll look at some of the languages that might be great to explore in 2022 based on factors such as their communities and growing job opportunities.

We won't be discussing the usual languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java etc. to make things interesting.

### #5 - Swift

Swift is a compiled language created by Apple in 2014 and [open sourced](https://github.com/apple/swift) in 2015.

It has quickly surpassed objective C and is the best choice for developing applications for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and other apple products.

However, It was designed to be a general-purpose language that is easier to write and more concise. So, it is not only limited to Apple products.

### #4 - Kotlin

Kotlin is an [open source](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin), statistically-typed programming language created by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) in 2011. You may know them from their fantastic IDE's such as IntelliJ and PyCharm.

It is officially supported by Google and is 100% Interoperable with Java, which makes switching from Java to Kotlin a smoother experience for Android app developers.

I will say that Kotlin is very similar to Swift in terms of its ideas and goals. So, you cannot go wrong with either.

### #3 - Rust

So Rust, is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed by Mozilla for performance and memory safety.

The Rust compiler is built on top of LLVM and has a really efficient data ownership model which guarantees memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

It is largely viewed as an alternative to other systems programming languages, like C or C++.

Mozilla says that it's a "language for the next 40 years" and I think they might be right.

Lastly, I'd say that It's a fantastic language but it comes with a steep learning curve since it has lots of features.

### #2 - TypeScript

So, I'm sure TypeScript needs no introduction but...let's do it anyways.

TypeScript is an [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) programming language developed by Microsoft.

It is often referred to as a superset of javascript which brings strict typing and many other important features.

Since its release in 2012, the language has remained in active development and continues to gain in popularity every year.

I've been working with TypeScript professionally for the last few years and it has made my life much easier. Based on my experience, if you're working with lots of javascript then TypeScript can offer significant benefits to your projects.

### #1 - Go

And finally, at number 1 we have Go, sometimes also known as Golang

Go is a statically typed, compiled language designed at Google and it is also [open source](https://github.com/golang/go).

It has a really powerful standard library that offers amazing flexibility and strong CSP-style concurrency support.

While Go is considered a minimalist language, it still scales gracefully and reliably.

Apart from Google, Go is also used by companies such as American Express, Netflix, Capital One, and many more.

Personally, I think it's a really productive language and I highly recommend it.

If you haven't tried any of these languages, this might be a great time to do so!
