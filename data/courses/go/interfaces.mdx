In this section, let's talk about the interfaces.

## What is an interface?

So, an interface in Go is an **abstract type** that is defined using a set of method signatures. The interface defines the **behavior** for similar types of objects.

_Here, **behavior** is a key term that we will discuss shortly._

Let's take a look at an example to understand this better.

One of the best real-world examples of interfaces is the power socket. Imagine that we need to connect different devices to the power socket.

![no-interface](/static/courses/go/chapter-III/interfaces/no-interface.png)

Let's try to implement this. Here are the device types we will be using.

```go
type mobile struct {
	brand string
}

type laptop struct {
	cpu string
}

type toaster struct {
	amount int
}

type kettle struct {
	quantity string
}

type socket struct{}
```

Now, let's define a `Draw` method on a type, let's say `mobile`. Here we will simply print the properties of the type.

```go
func (m mobile) Draw(power int) {
	fmt.Printf("%T -> brand: %s, power: %d", m, m.brand, power)
}
```

Great, now we will define the `Plug` method on the `socket` type which accepts our `mobile` type as an argument.

```go
func (socket) Plug(device mobile, power int) {
	device.Draw(power)
}
```

Let's try to _"connect"_ or _"plug in"_ the `mobile` type to our `socket` type in the `main` function.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	m := mobile{"Apple"}

	s := socket{}
	s.Plug(m, 10)
}
```

And if we run this we'll see the following.

```bash
$ go run main.go
main.mobile -> brand: Apple, power: 10
```

This is interesting, but let's say now we want to connect our `laptop` type.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	m := mobile{"Apple"}
	l := laptop{"Intel i9"}

	s := socket{}

	s.Plug(m, 10)
	s.Plug(l, 50) // Error: cannot use l as mobile value in argument
}
```

As we can see, this will throw an error.

**What should we do now? Define another method? Such as `PlugLaptop`?**

Sure, but then every time we add a new device type we will need to add a new method to the socket type as well and that's not ideal.

This is where the `interface` comes in. Essentially, we want to define a **contract** that, in the future, must be implemented.

We can simply define an interface such as `PowerDrawer` and use it in our `Plug` function to allow any device that satisfies the criteria, which is that the type must have a `Draw` method matching the signature that the interface requires.

And anyways, the socket doesn't need to know anything about our device and can simply call the `Draw` method.

![interface](/static/courses/go/chapter-III/interfaces/interface.png)

Now let's try to implement our `PowerDrawer` interface. Here's how it will look.

The convention is to use **"-er"** as a suffix in the name. And as we discussed earlier, an interface should only describe the **expected behavior**. Which in our case is the `Draw` method.

![interface-implementation](/static/courses/go/chapter-III/interfaces/interface-implementation.png)

```go
type PowerDrawer interface {
	Draw(power int)
}
```

Now, we need to update our `Plug` method to accept a device that implements the `PowerDrawer` interface as an argument.

```go
func (socket) Plug(device PowerDrawer, power int) {
	device.Draw(power)
}
```

And to satisfy the interface, we can simply add `Draw` methods to all the device types.

```go
type mobile struct {
	brand string
}

func (m mobile) Draw(power int) {
	fmt.Printf("%T -> brand: %s, power: %d\n", m, m.brand, power)
}

type laptop struct {
	cpu string
}

func (l laptop) Draw(power int) {
	fmt.Printf("%T -> cpu: %s, power: %d\n", l, l.cpu, power)
}

type toaster struct {
	amount int
}

func (t toaster) Draw(power int) {
	fmt.Printf("%T -> amount: %d, power: %d\n", t, t.amount, power)
}

type kettle struct {
	quantity string
}

func (k kettle) Draw(power int) {
	fmt.Printf("%T -> quantity: %s, power: %d\n", k, k.quantity, power)
}
```

Now, we can connect all our devices to the socket with the help of our interface!

```go
func main() {
	m := mobile{"Apple"}
	l := laptop{"Intel i9"}
	t := toaster{4}
	k := kettle{"50%"}

	s := socket{}

	s.Plug(m, 10)
	s.Plug(l, 50)
	s.Plug(t, 30)
	s.Plug(k, 25)
}
```

And it works just as we expected.

```bash
$ go run main.go
main.mobile -> brand: Apple, power: 10
main.laptop -> cpu: Intel i9, power: 50
main.toaster -> amount: 4, power: 30
main.kettle -> quantity: Half Empty, power: 25
```

**But why is this considered such a powerful concept?**

Well, an interface can help us decouple our types. For example, because we have the interface, we don't need to update our `socket` implementation. We can just define a new device type with a `Draw` method.

Unlike other languages, Go Interfaces are implemented **implicitly**, so we don't need something like an `implements` keyword. This means that a type satisfies an interface automatically when it has _"all the methods"_ of the interface.

## Empty Interface

Next, let's talk about the empty interface. An empty interface can take on a value of any type.

Here's how we declare it.

```go
var x interface{}
```

**But why do we need it?**

Empty interfaces can be used to handle values of unknown types.

Some examples are:

- Reading heterogeneous data from an API.
- Variables of an unknown type, like in the `fmt.Println` function.

To use a value of type empty `interface{}`, we can use _type assertion_ or a _type switch_ to determine the type of the value.

## Type Assertion

A _type assertion_ provides access to an interface value's underlying concrete value.

For example:

```go
func main() {
	var i interface{} = "hello"

	s := i.(string)
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

This statement asserts that the interface value holds a concrete type and assigns the underlying type value to the variable.

We can also test whether an interface value holds a specific type.

A type assertion can return two values:

- The first one is the underlying value.
- The second is a boolean value that reports whether the assertion succeeded.

```go
s, ok := i.(string)
fmt.Println(s, ok)
```

This can help us test whether an interface value holds a specific type or not.

In a way, this is similar to how we read values from a map.

And If this is not the case then, `ok` will be false and the value will be the zero value of the type, and no panic will occur.

```go
f, ok := i.(float64)
fmt.Println(f, ok)
```

But if the interface does not hold the type, the statement will trigger a panic.

```go
f = i.(float64)
fmt.Println(f) // Panic!
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
hello
hello true
0 false
panic: interface conversion: interface {} is string, not float64
```

## Type Switch

Here, a `switch` statement can be used to determine the type of a variable of type empty `interface{}`.

```go
var t interface{}
t = "hello"

switch t := t.(type) {
case string:
	fmt.Printf("string: %s\n", t)
case bool:
	fmt.Printf("boolean: %v\n", t)
case int:
	fmt.Printf("integer: %d\n", t)
default:
	fmt.Printf("unexpected: %T\n", t)
}
```

And if we run this, we can verify that we have a `string` type.

```bash
$ go run main.go
string: hello
```

## Properties

Let's discuss some properties of interfaces.

### Zero value

The zero value of an interface is `nil`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MyInterface interface {
	Method()
}

func main() {
	var i MyInterface

	fmt.Println(i) // Output: <nil>
}
```

### Embedding

We can embed interfaces like structs. For example:

```go
type interface1 interface {
    Method1()
}

type interface2 interface {
    Method2()
}

type interface3 interface {
    interface1
    interface2
}
```

### Values

Interface values are comparable.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MyInterface interface {
	Method()
}

type MyType struct{}

func (MyType) Method() {}

func main() {
	t := MyType{}
	var i MyInterface = MyType{}

	fmt.Println(t == i)
}
```

### Interface Values

Under the hood, an interface value can be thought of as a tuple consisting of a value and a concrete type.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MyInterface interface {
	Method()
}

type MyType struct {
	property int
}

func (MyType) Method() {}

func main() {
	var i MyInterface

	i = MyType{10}

	fmt.Printf("(%v, %T)\n", i, i) // Output: ({10}, main.MyType)
}
```

With that, we covered interfaces in Go.

It's a really powerful feature, but remember, _"Bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction"_ - Rob Pike.
