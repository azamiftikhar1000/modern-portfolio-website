In this tutorial, we will learn about string formatting or sometimes also known as templating.

`fmt` package contains lots of functions. So to save time, we will discuss the most frequently used functions. Let's start with `fmt.Print` inside our main function.

```go
...

fmt.Print("What", "is", "your", "name?")
fmt.Print("My", "name", "is", "golang")
...
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Whatisyourname?Mynameisgolang
```

As we can see, `Print` does not format anything, it simply takes a string and prints it.

Next, we have `Println` which is the same as `Print` but it adds a new line at the end and also inserts space between the arguments.

```go
...

fmt.Println("What", "is", "your", "name?")
fmt.Println("My", "name", "is", "golang")
...
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
What is your name?
My name is golang
```

That's much better!

Next, we have `Printf` also known as _"Print Formatter"_, which allows us to format numbers, strings, booleans, and much more.

Let's look at an example.

```go
...
name := "golang"

fmt.Println("What is your name?")
fmt.Printf("My name is %s", name)
...
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
What is your name?
My name is golang
```

As we can see that `%s` was substituted with our `name` variable.

But the question is what is `%s` and what does it mean?

So, these are called _annotation verbs_ and they tell the function how to format the arguments. We can control things like width, types, and precision with these and there are lots of them. Here's a [cheatsheet](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt).

Now, let's quickly look at some more examples. Here we will try to calculate a percentage and print it to the console.

```go
...
percent := (7.0 / 9) * 100
fmt.Printf("%f", percent)
...
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
77.777778
```

Let's say we want just `77.78` which is 2 points precision, we can do that as well by using `.2f`.

Also, to add an actual percent sign, we will need to _escape it_.

```go
...
percent := (7.0 / 9) * 100
fmt.Printf("%.2f %%", percent)
...
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
77.78 %
```

This brings us to `Sprint`, `Sprintln`, and `Sprintf`. These are basically the same as the print functions, the only difference being they return the string instead of printing it.

Let's take a look at an example.

```go
...
s := fmt.Sprintf("hex:%x bin:%b", 10 ,10)
fmt.Println(s)
...
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
hex:a bin:1010
```

So, as we can see `Sprintf` formats our integer as hex or binary and returns it as a string.

Lastly, we have multiline string literals, which can be used like this.

```go
...
msg := `
Hello from
multiline
`

fmt.Println(msg)
...
```

Great! But this is just the tip of the iceberg...so make sure to check out the go doc for `fmt` package.

For those who are coming from C/C++ background, this should feel natural, but if you're coming from, let's say Python or JavaScript, this might be a little strange at first. But it is very powerful and you'll see this functionality used quite extensively.
