Building static binaries is one of the best features of Go which enables us to ship our code efficiently.

We can do this very easily using the `go build` command.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("I am a binary!")
}
```

```bash
$ go build
```

This should produce a binary with the name of our module. For example, here we have `example`.

We can also specify the output.

```bash
$ go build -o app
```

Now to run this, we simply need to execute it.

```bash
$ ./app
I am a binary!
```

_Yes, it's as simple as that!_

Now, let's talk about some important build time variables, starting with:

- `GOOS` and `GOARCH`

These environment variables help us build go programs for different [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)
and underlying processor [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture).

We can list all the supported architecture using `go tool` command.

```bash
$ go tool dist list
android/amd64
ios/amd64
js/wasm
linux/amd64
windows/arm64
.
.
.
```

Here's an example for building a windows executable from macOS!

```bash
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app.exe
```

- `CGO_ENABLED`

This variable allows us to configure [CGO](https://go.dev/blog/cgo), which is a way in Go to call C code.

This helps us to produce a [statically linked binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_build) that works without any external dependencies.

This is quite helpful for, let's say when we want to run our go binaries in a docker container with minimum external dependencies.

Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app
```
