In this tutorial, we will learn about arrays and slices in Go.

## Arrays

### What is an array?

An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. The elements of the array are stored sequentially and can be accessed using their `index`.

![array](/static/courses/go/chapter-II/arrays-and-slices/array.png)

### Declaration

We can declare an array as follows:

```go
var a [n]T
```

Here, `n` is the length and `T` can be any type like integer, string, or user-defined structs.

Now, let's declare an array of integers with length 4 and print it.

```go
func main() {
	var arr [4]int

	fmt.Println(arr)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
[0 0 0 0]
```

By default, all the array elements are initialized with the zero value of the corresponding array type.

### Initialization

We can also initialize an array using an array literal.

```go
var a [n]T = [n]T{V1, V2, ... Vn}
```

```go
func main() {
	var arr = [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4}

	fmt.Println(arr)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
[1 2 3 4]
```

We can even do a shorthand declaration.

```go
...
arr := [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### Access

And similar to other languages, we can access the elements using the `index` as they're stored sequentially.

```go
func main() {
	arr := [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4}

	fmt.Println(arr[0])
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
1
```

### Iteration

Now, let's talk about iteration.

So, there are multiple ways to iterate over arrays.

The first one is using the for loop with the `len` function which gives us the length of the array.

```go
func main() {
	arr := [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4}

	for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
		fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Element: %d\n", i, arr[i])
	}
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Index: 0, Element: 1
Index: 1, Element: 2
Index: 2, Element: 3
Index: 3, Element: 4
```

Another way is to use the `range` keyword with the `for` loop.

```go
func main() {
	arr := [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4}

	for i, e := range arr {
		fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Element: %d\n", i, e)
	}
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Index: 0, Element: 1
Index: 1, Element: 2
Index: 2, Element: 3
Index: 3, Element: 4
```

As we can see, our example works the same as before.

But the range keyword is quite versatile and can be used in multiple ways.

```go
for i, e := range arr {} // Normal usage of range

for _, e := range arr {} // Omit index with _ and use element

for i := range arr {} // Use index only

for range arr {} // Simply loop over the array
```

### Multi dimensional

All the arrays that we created so far are one-dimensional. We can also create multi-dimensional arrays in Go.

Let's take a look at an example:

```go
func main() {
	arr := [2][4]int{
		{1, 2, 3, 4},
		{5, 6, 7, 8},
	}

	for i, e := range arr {
		fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Element: %d\n", i, e)
	}
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Index: 0, Element: [1 2 3 4]
Index: 1, Element: [5 6 7 8]
```

We can also let the compiler infer the length of the array by using `...` ellipses instead of the length.

```go
func main() {
	arr := [...][4]int{
		{1, 2, 3, 4},
		{5, 6, 7, 8},
	}

	for i, e := range arr {
		fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Element: %d\n", i, e)
	}
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Index: 0, Element: [1 2 3 4]
Index: 1, Element: [5 6 7 8]
```

### Properties

Now let's talk about some properties of arrays.

The array's length is part of its type. So, the array `a` and `b` are completely distinct types, and we cannot assign one to the other.

This also means that we cannot resize an array, because resizing an array would mean changing its type.

```go
package main

func main() {
	var a = [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4}
	var b [2]int = a // Error, cannot use a (type [4]int) as type [2]int in assignment
}
```

Arrays in Go are value types unlike other languages like C, C++, and Java where arrays are reference types.

This means that when we assign an array to a new variable or pass an array to a function, the entire array is copied.

So, if we make any changes to this copied array, the original array won't be affected and will remain unchanged.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a = [7]string{"Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"}
	var b = a // Copy of a is assigned to b

	b[0] = "Monday"

	fmt.Println(a) // Output: [Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun]
	fmt.Println(b) // Output: [Monday Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun]
}
```

## Slices

I know what you're thinking, arrays are useful but a bit inflexible due to the limitation caused by their fixed size.

This brings us to Slice, so what is a slice?

A Slice is a segment of an array. Slices build on arrays and provide more power, flexibility, and convenience.

![slice](/static/courses/go/chapter-II/arrays-and-slices/slice.png)

A slice consists of three things:

- A pointer reference to an underlying array.
- The length of the segment of the array that the slice contains.
- And, the capacity, which is the maximum size up to which the segment can grow.

Just like `len` function, we can determine the capacity of a slice using the built-in `cap` function. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := [5]int{20, 15, 5, 30, 25}

	s := a[1:4]

	// Output: Array: [20 15 5 30 25], Length: 5, Capacity: 5
	fmt.Printf("Array: %v, Length: %d, Capacity: %d\n", a, len(a), cap(a))

	// Output: Slice [15 5 30], Length: 3, Capacity: 4
	fmt.Printf("Slice: %v, Length: %d, Capacity: %d", s, len(s), cap(s))
}
```

Don't worry, we are going to discuss everything shown here in detail.

### Declaration

Let's see how we can declare a slice.

```go
var s []T
```

As we can see, we don't need to specify any length. Let's declare a slice of integers and see how it works.

```go
func main() {
	var s []string

	fmt.Println(s)
	fmt.Println(s == nil)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
[]
true
```

So, unlike arrays, the zero value of a slice is `nil`.

### Initialization

There are multiple ways to initialize our slice. One way is to use the built-in `make` function.

```go
make([]T, len, cap) []T
```

```go
func main() {
	var s = make([]string, 0, 0)

	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
[]
```

Similar to arrays, we can use the slice literal to initialize our slice.

```go
func main() {
	var s = []string{"Go", "TypeScript"}

	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
[Go TypeScript]
```

Another way is to create a slice from an array. Since a slice is a segment of an array, we can create a slice from index `low` to `high` as follows.

```go
a[low:high]
```

```go
func main() {
	var a = [4]string{
		"C++",
		"Go",
		"Java",
		"TypeScript",
	}

	s1 := a[0:2] // Select from 0 to 2
	s2 := a[:3]  // Select first 3
	s3 := a[2:]  // Select last 2

	fmt.Println("Array:", a)
	fmt.Println("Slice 1:", s1)
	fmt.Println("Slice 2:", s2)
	fmt.Println("Slice 3:", s3)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Array: [C++ Go Java TypeScript]
Slice 1: [C++ Go]
Slice 2: [C++ Go Java]
Slice 3: [Java TypeScript]
```

_Missing low index implies 0 and missing high index implies the length of the underlying array (`len(a)`)._

The thing to note here is we can create a slice from other slices too and not just arrays.

```go
var a = []string{
	"C++",
	"Go",
	"Java",
	"TypeScript",
}
```

### Iteration

We can iterate over a slice in the same way you iterate over an array, by using the for loop with either `len` function or `range` keyword.

### Functions

So now, let's talk about built-in slice functions provided in Go.

**copy**

The `copy()` function copies elements from one slice to another. It takes 2 slices, a destination, and a source. It also returns the number of elements copied.

```go
func copy(dst, src []T) int
```

Let's see how we can use it.

```go
func main() {
	s1 := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
	s2 := make([]string, len(s1))

	e := copy(s2, s1)

	fmt.Println("Src:", s1)
	fmt.Println("Dst:", s2)
	fmt.Println("Elements:", e)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Src: [a b c d]
Dst: [a b c d]
Elements: 4
```

As expected, our 4 elements from the source slice were copied to the destination slice.

**append**

Now, let's look at how we can append data to our slice using the built-in `append` function which appends new elements at the end of a given slice.

It takes a slice and a variable number of arguments. It then returns a new slice containing all the elements.

```go
append(slice []T, elems ...T) []T
```

Let's try it in an example by appending elements to our slice.

```go
func main() {
	s1 := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}

	s2 := append(s1, "e", "f")

	fmt.Println("s1:", s1)
	fmt.Println("s2:", s2)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
s1: [a b c d]
s2: [a b c d e f]
```

As we can see, the new elements were appended and a new slice was returned.

But if the given slice doesn't have sufficient capacity for the new elements then a new underlying array is allocated with a bigger capacity.

All the elements from the underlying array of the existing slice are copied to this new array, and then the new elements are appended.

### Properties

Finally, let's discuss some properties of slices.

Slices are reference types, unlike arrays.

This means modifying the elements of a slice will modify the corresponding elements in the referenced array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := [7]string{"Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"}

	s := a[0:2]

	s[0] = "Sun"

	fmt.Println(a) // Output: [Sun Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun]
	fmt.Println(s) // Output: [Sun Tue]
}
```

Slices can be used with variadic types as well.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	values := []int{1, 2, 3}
	sum := add(values...)
	fmt.Println(sum)
}

func add(values ...int) int {
	sum := 0
	for _, v := range values {
		sum += v
	}

	return sum
}
```
