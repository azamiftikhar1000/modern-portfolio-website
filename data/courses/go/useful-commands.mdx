During our module discussion, we discussed some go commands related to go modules, let's now discuss some other important commands.

Starting with `go fmt`, which formats the source code and it's enforced by that language so that we can focus on how our code should work rather than how our code should look.

```bash
$ go fmt
```

This might seem a little weird at first especially if you're coming from a javascript or python background like me but frankly, it's quite nice not to worry about linting rules.

Next, we have `go vet` which reports likely mistakes in our packages.

So, if I go ahead and make a mistake in the syntax, and then run `go vet`.

It should notify me of the errors.

```bash
$ go vet
```

Next, we have `go env` which simply prints all the go environment information, we'll learn about some of these build-time variables later.

Lastly, we have `go doc` which shows documentation for a package or symbol, here's an example of the `fmt` package.

```bash
$ go doc -src fmt Printf
```

Let's use `go help` command to see what other commands are available.

```bash
$ go help
```

As we can see, we have:

`go fix` finds Go programs that use old APIs and rewrites them to use newer ones.

`go generate` is usually used for code generation.

`go install` compiles and installs packages and dependencies.

`go clean` is used for cleaning files that are generated by compilers.

Some other very important commands are `go build` and `go test` but we will learn about them in detail later in the course.
