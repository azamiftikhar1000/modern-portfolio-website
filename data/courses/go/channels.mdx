In this lesson, we will learn about Channels.

## So what are channels?

Well, simply defined a channel is a communications pipe between goroutines. Things go in one end and come out another in the same order until the channel is closed.

![channel](/static/courses/go/chapter-IV/channels/channel.png)

As we learned earlier, channels in Go are based on Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).

## Creating a channel

Now that we understand what channels are, let's see how we can declare them.

```go
var ch chan T
```

Here, we prefix our type `T` which is the data type of the value we want to send and receive with the keyword `chan` which stands for a channel.

Let's try printing the value of our channel `c` of type `string`.

```go
func main() {
	var ch chan string

	fmt.Println(c)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
<nil>
```

As we can see, the zero value of a channel is `nil` and if we try to send data over the channel our program will panic.

So, similar to slices we can initialize our channel using the built-in `make` function.

```go
func main() {
	ch := make(chan string)

	fmt.Println(c)
}
```

And if we run this, we can see our channel was initialized.

```bash
$ go run main.go
0x1400010e060
```

## Sending and Receiving data

Now that we have a basic understanding of channels, let us implement our earlier example using channels to learn how we can use them to communicate between our goroutines.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func speak(arg string, ch chan string) {
	ch <- arg // Send
}

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string)

	go speak("Hello World", ch)

	data := <-ch // Receive
	fmt.Println(data)
}
```

Notice how we can send data using the `channel<-data` and receive data using the `data := <-channel` syntax.

```bash
$ go run main.go
Hello World
```

Perfect, our program ran as we expected.

## Buffered Channels

We also have buffered channels that accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values.

![buffered-channel](/static/courses/go/chapter-IV/channels/buffered-channel.png)

This _buffer length_ or _capacity_ can be specified using the second argument to the `make` function.

```go
func main() {
	ch := make(chan string, 2)

	go speak("Hello World", ch)
	go speak("Hi again", ch)

	data1 := <-ch
	fmt.Println(data1)

	data2 := <-ch
	fmt.Println(data2)
}
```

Because this channel is buffered, we can send these values into the channel without a corresponding concurrent receive. This means _sends_ to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full and _receives_ block when the buffer is empty.

By default, a channel is unbuffered and has a capacity of 0, hence, we omit the second argument of the `make` function.

Next, we have directional channels.

## Directional channels

When using channels as function parameters, we can specify if a channel is meant to only send or receive values. This increases the type-safety of our program as by default a channel can both send and receive values.

![directional-channels](/static/courses/go/chapter-IV/channels/directional-channels.png)

In our example, we can update our `speak` function's second argument such that it can only send a value.

```go
func speak(arg string, ch chan<- string) {
	ch <- arg // Send Only
}
```

Here, `chan<-` can only be used for sending values and will panic if we try to receive values.

## Closing channels

Also, just like any other resource, once we're done with our channel, we need to close it. This can be achieved using the built-in `close` function.

Here, we can just pass our channel to the `close` function.

```go
func main() {
	ch := make(chan string, 2)

	go speak("Hello World", ch)
	go speak("Hi again", ch)

	data1 := <-ch
	fmt.Println(data1)

	data2 := <-ch
	fmt.Println(data2)

	close(ch)
}
```

Optionally, receivers can test whether a channel has been closed by assigning a second parameter to the receive expression.

```go
func main() {
	ch := make(chan string, 2)

	go speak("Hello World", ch)
	go speak("Hi again", ch)

	data1 := <-ch
	fmt.Println(data1)

	data2, ok := <-ch
	fmt.Println(data2, ok)

	close(ch)
}
```

if `ok` is `false` then there are no more values to receive and the channel is closed.

_In a way, this is similar to how we check if a key exists or not in a map._

## Properties

Lastly, let's discuss some properties of channels:

- A send to a `nil` channel blocks forever.

```go
var c chan string
c <- "Hello, World!" // Panic: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
```

- A receive from a `nil` channel blocks forever.

```go
var c chan string
fmt.Println(<-c) // Panic: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
```

- A send to a closed channel causes a panic.

```go
var c = make(chan string, 1)
c <- "Hello, World!"
close(c)
c <- "Hello, Panic!" // Panic: send on closed channel
```

- A receive from a closed channel returns the zero value immediately.

```go
var c = make(chan int, 2)
c <- 5
c <- 4
close(c)
for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%d ", <-c) // Output: 5 4 0 0
}
```

- Range over channels.

We can also use `for` and `range` to iterate over values received from a channel.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string, 2)

	ch <- "Hello"
	ch <- "World"

	close(ch)

	for data := range ch {
		fmt.Println(data)
	}
}
```
