Go (also known as _Golang_) is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 and open-sourced in 2009.

It focuses on simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. It was designed to combine the efficacy, speed, and safety of a statically typed and compiled language with the ease of programming of a dynamic language to make programming more fun again.

In a way, they wanted to combine the best parts of Python and C++ so that they can build reliable systems that can take advantage of multi-core processors.
