Let's write our first hello world program, we can start by initializing a module. For that, we can use the `go mod` command.

```bash
$ go mod init example
```

But wait...what's a `module`? Don't worry we will discuss that soon! But for now, assume that the module is basically a collection of Go packages.

Moving ahead, let's now create a `main.go` file and write a program that simply prints hello world.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

_If you're wondering, `fmt` is part of the Go standard library which is a set of core packages provided by the language._

## Structure of a Go program

Now, let's quickly break down what we did here, or rather the structure of a Go program.

First, we defined a package such as `main`.

```go
package main
```

Then, we have some imports.

```go
import "fmt"
```

Last but not least, is our `main` function which acts as an entry point for our application, just like in other languages like C, Java, or C#.

```go
func main() {
	...
}
```

Remember, the goal here is to keep a mental note, and later in the course, we'll learn about `functions`, `imports`, and other things in detail!

Finally, to run our code, we can simply use `go run` command.

```bash
$ go run main.go
Hello World!
```

Congratulations, you just wrote your first Go program!
