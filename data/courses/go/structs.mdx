In this tutorial, we will learn about structs.

So, a `struct` is a user-defined type that contains a collection of named fields. Basically, it is used to group related data together to form a single unit.

If you're coming from an objected-oriented background, think of structs as lightweight classes which that support composition but not inheritance.

## Defining

We can define a `struct` like this:

```go
type Person struct {}
```

We use the `type` keyword to introduce a new type, followed by the name and then the `struct` keyword to indicate that we're defining a struct.

Now, let's give it some fields:

```go
type Person struct {
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
	Age       int
}
```

And, if the fields have the same type, we can collapse them as well.

```go
type Person struct {
	FirstName, LastName string
	Age                 int
}
```

## Declaring and initializing

Now that we have our struct, we can declare it the same as other datatypes.

```go
func main() {
	var p1 Person

	fmt.Println("Person 1:", p1)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Person 1: {  0}
```

As we can see, all the struct fields are initialized with their zero values. So the `FirstName` and `LastName` are set to `""` empty string and `Age` is set to 0.

We can also initialize it as _"struct literal"_.

```go
func main() {
	var p1 Person

	fmt.Println("Person 1:", p1)

	var p2 = Person{FirstName: "Azam", LastName: "Iftikhar", Age: 22}

	fmt.Println("Person 2:", p2)
}
```

For readability, we can separate by new line but this will also require a trailing comma.

```go
	var p2 = Person{
		FirstName: "Azam",
		LastName:  "Iftikhar",
		Age:       22,
	}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Person 1: {  0}
Person 2: {Azam Iftikhar 22}
```

We can also initialize only a subset of fields.

```go
func main() {
	var p1 Person

	fmt.Println("Person 1:", p1)

	var p2 = Person{
		FirstName: "Azam",
		LastName:  "Iftikhar",
		Age:       22,
	}

	fmt.Println("Person 2:", p2)

	var p3 = Person{
		FirstName: "Tony",
		LastName:  "Stark",
	}

	fmt.Println("Person 3:", p3)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Person 1: {  0}
Person 2: {Azam Iftikhar 22}
Person 3: {Tony Stark 0}
```

As we can see, the age field of person 3 has defaulted to the zero value.

## Without field name

Go structs also supports initialization without field names.

```go
func main() {
	var p1 Person

	fmt.Println("Person 1:", p1)

	var p2 = Person{
		FirstName: "Azam",
		LastName:  "Iftikhar",
		Age:       22,
	}

	fmt.Println("Person 2:", p2)

	var p3 = Person{
		FirstName: "Tony",
		LastName:  "Stark",
	}

	fmt.Println("Person 3:", p3)

	var p4 = Person{"Bruce", "Wayne"}

	fmt.Println("Person 4:", p4)
}
```

But here's the catch, we will need to provide all the values during the initialization or it will fail.

```bash
$ go run main.go
# command-line-arguments
./main.go:30:27: too few values in Person{...}
```

```go
	var p4 = Person{"Bruce", "Wayne", 40}

	fmt.Println("Person 4:", p4)
```

We can also declare an anonymous struct.

```go
func main() {
	var p1 Person

	fmt.Println("Person 1:", p1)

	var p2 = Person{
		FirstName: "Azam",
		LastName:  "Iftikhar",
		Age:       22,
	}

	fmt.Println("Person 2:", p2)

	var p3 = Person{
		FirstName: "Tony",
		LastName:  "Stark",
	}

	fmt.Println("Person 3:", p3)

	var p4 = Person{"Bruce", "Wayne", 40}

	fmt.Println("Person 4:", p4)

	var a = struct {
		Name string
	}{"Golang"}

	fmt.Println("Anonymous:", a)
}
```

## Accessing fields

Let's clean up our example a bit and see how we can access individual fields.

```go
func main() {
	var p = Person{
		FirstName: "Azam",
		LastName:  "Iftikhar",
		Age:       22,
	}

	fmt.Println("FirstName", p.FirstName)
}
```

We can also create a pointer to structs as well.

```go
func main() {
	var p = Person{
		FirstName: "Azam",
		LastName:  "Iftikhar",
		Age:       22,
	}

	ptr := &p

	fmt.Println((*ptr).FirstName)
	fmt.Println(ptr.FirstName)
}
```

Both statements are equal as in Go we don't need to explicitly dereference the pointer. We can also use the built-in `new` function.

```go
func main() {
	p := new(Person)

	p.FirstName = "Azam"
	p.LastName = "Iftikhar"
	p.Age = 22

	fmt.Println("Person", p)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
Person &{Azam Iftikhar 22}
```

As a side note, two structs are equal if all their corresponding fields are equal as well.

```go
func main() {
	var p1 = Person{"a", "b", 20}
	var p2 = Person{"a", "b", 20}

	fmt.Println(p1 == p2)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
true
```

## Exported fields

Now let's learn what is exported and unexported fields in a struct. Same as the rules for variables and functions, if a struct field is declared with a lower case identifier, it will not be exported and only be visible to the package it is defined in.

```go
type Person struct {
	FirstName, LastName  string
	Age                  int
	zipCode              string
}
```

So, the `zipCode` field won't be exported. Also, the same goes for the `Person` struct, if we rename it as `person`, it won't be exported as well.

```go
type person struct {
	FirstName, LastName  string
	Age                  int
	zipCode              string
}
```

## Embedding and composition

As we discussed earlier, Go doesn't necessarily support inheritance, but we can do something similar with embedding.

```go
type Person struct {
	FirstName, LastName  string
	Age                  int
}

type SuperHero struct {
	Person
	Alias string
}
```

So, our new struct will have all the properties of the original struct. And it should behave the same as our normal struct.

```go
func main() {
	s := SuperHero{}

	s.FirstName = "Bruce"
	s.LastName = "Wayne"
	s.Age = 40
	s.Alias = "batman"

	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
{{Bruce Wayne 40} batman}
```

However, this is usually not recommended and in most cases, composition is preferred. So rather than embedding, we will just define it as a normal field.

```go
type Person struct {
	FirstName, LastName  string
	Age                  int
}

type SuperHero struct {
	Person Person
	Alias  string
}
```

Hence, we can rewrite our example with composition as well.

```go
func main() {
	p := Person{"Bruce", "Wayne", 40}
	s := SuperHero{p, "batman"}

	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

```bash
$ go run main.go
{{Bruce Wayne 40} batman}
```

Again, there is no right or wrong here, but nonetheless, embedding comes in handy sometimes.

## Struct tags

A struct tag is just a tag that allows us to attach metadata information to the field which can be used for custom behavior using the `reflect` package.

Let's learn how we can define struct tags.

```go
type Animal struct {
	Name    string `key:"value1"`
	Age     int    `key:"value2"`
}
```

You will often find tags in encoding packages, such as XML, JSON, YAML, ORMs, and Configuration management.

Here's a tags example for the JSON encoder.

```go
type Animal struct {
	Name    string `json:"name"`
	Age     int    `json:"age"`
}
```

## Properties

Finally, let's discuss the properties of structs.

Structs are value types. When we assign one `struct` variable to another, a new copy of the `struct` is created and assigned.

Similarly, when we pass a `struct` to another function, the function gets its own copy of the `struct`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Point struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func main() {
	p1 := Point{1, 2}
	p2 := p1 // Copy of p1 is assigned to p2

	p2.X = 2

	fmt.Println(p1) // Output: {1 2}
	fmt.Println(p2) // Output: {2 2}
}
```

Empty struct occupies zero bytes of storage.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	var s struct{}
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Sizeof(s)) // Output: 0
}
```
