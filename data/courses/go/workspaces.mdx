In this tutorial, we will learn about multi-module workspaces that were introduced in Go 1.18.

Workspaces allow us to work with multiple modules simultaneously without having to edit `go.mod` files for each module. Each module within a workspace is treated as a root module when resolving dependencies.

To understand this better, let's start by creating a `hello` module.

```bash
$ mkdir workspaces && cd workspaces
$ mkdir hello && cd hello
$ go mod init hello
```

For demonstration purposes, I will add a simple `main.go` and install an example package.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"golang.org/x/example/stringutil"
)

func main() {
	result := stringutil.Reverse("Hello Workspace")
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

```bash
$ go get golang.org/x/example
go: downloading golang.org/x/example v0.0.0-20220412213650-2e68773dfca0
go: added golang.org/x/example v0.0.0-20220412213650-2e68773dfca0
```

And if we run this, we should see our output in reverse.

```bash
$ go run main.go
ecapskroW olleH
```

This is great, but what if we want to modify the `stringutil` module that our code depends on?

Until now, we had to do it using the `replace` directive in the `go.mod` file, but now let's see how we can use workspaces here.

So, let's create our workspace in the `workspaces` directory.

```bash
$ go work init
```

This will create a `go.work` file.

```bash
$ cat go.work
go 1.18
```

We will also add our `hello` module to the workspace.

```bash
$ go work use ./hello
```

This should update the `go.work` file with a reference to our `hello` module.

```go
go 1.18

use ./hello
```

Now, let's download and modify the `stringutil` package and update the `Reverse` function implementation.

```bash
$ git clone https://go.googlesource.com/example
Cloning into 'example'...
remote: Total 204 (delta 39), reused 204 (delta 39)
Receiving objects: 100% (204/204), 467.53 KiB | 363.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (39/39), done.
```

`example/stringutil/reverse.go`

```go
func Reverse(s string) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("I can do whatever!! %s", s)
}
```

Finally, let's add `example` package to our workspace.

```bash
$ go work use ./example
$ cat go.work
go 1.18

use (
	./example
	./hello
)
```

Perfect, now if we run our `hello` module we will notice that the `Reverse` function has been modified.

```bash
$ go run hello
I can do whatever!! Hello Workspace
```

_This is a very underrated feature from Go 1.18 but it is quite useful in certain circumstances._
